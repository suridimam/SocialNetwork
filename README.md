# SocialNetwork
A java based social network application created in NetBeans

This application is intended for High School students who have difficulty making friends.
Users can create an account and select their school. They are then placed in a pool with other 
users who attend the same school. Users can then take a short personality test and select a few
of their interests to complete their profile. This information is then used to reccomend 
other users with the same interests who go to the same school. Users can also send friend requests
directly to other users if they know their username. 

Users who are friends can message each other.

Any user can create an event for other users who go to the same school. These events are public
and everyone who attends the school can see them.
